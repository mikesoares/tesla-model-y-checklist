## Final thoughts about your delivery inspection

Please don't be "that guy" that blocks Tesla deliveries and staff for hours while going over your new car with a microscope!
You can report all of the above after you get home, at your leisure: you have a day/100 miles. It’s not like you won’t
accept the car because of some minor issue that can be fixed by a mobile service tech later (but won’t be fixed at
pickup).   Visit and check the local super charger while you are there, too.

Better yet, if you can, pick up the car in person at an express checkout site. Assuming all of your affairs are in order via
the website, Tesla will park your car in their lot and put your name on it. You simply sign the paperwork they leave on the dash,
deposit the paperwork in a bin, and drive off. This allows you all the time you require to inspect the vehicle before deciding
to accept the car or not. Do note that the express checkout is often staffed by temporary hires or other low-level staff as their
only function is to shuffle the cars around and ensure the proper paperwork awaits you. Any problems that may arise they will simply
ask you to schedule an appointment to come back in with the vehicle. Plan accordingly: do not pickup the vehicle at dusk and have
to examine everything in darkness.

This car is quite pricey. Make sure it is absolutely what you want before you accept delivery. With the recent push to "make the numbers,"
Tesla is selling cars at a faster clip than they are staffing up at. Wait times to get any issues resolved "later" may be immense.
